This project aims to introduce the reader to technologies used for storing, retrieving and analyzing Big Data, which can come in the form of various data sources. Conventional solutions are often unable to effectively manage such data, but Big Data analysis systems can handle large, heterogeneous and non-uniform data from relational databases, retrieve large data sets from various systems, perform natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and prediction based on unstructured data. The project will focus on practical data management using open source tools, specifically using Cassandra.
