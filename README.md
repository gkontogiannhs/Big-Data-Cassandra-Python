## Project Aim
This project aims to introduce the reader to technologies used for storing, retrieving and analyzing Big Data, which can come in the form of various data sources.
The focus is on practical data management using open source tools, specifically Datastax and AstraDB for the Cassandra cluster. The retrieval process is done through Python Cassandra API, which allows for easy interaction with the Cassandra database.

## Why Bother
Conventional solutions are often unable to effectively manage such data, but Big Data analysis systems can handle large, heterogeneous and non-uniform data from relational databases, retrieve large data sets from various systems, perform natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and prediction based on unstructured data.
